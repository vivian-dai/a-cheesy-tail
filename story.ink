=== story ===
... bump ... ba ... dum ba-bump. The rat comes to life with a seizing pain in its head, and is warmly welcomed by the gasoline fire. Sirens wail in the background, though too faint for the rat to care. The rat now has a choice to make:
+ [Walk into the fire] -> walk_into_fire
+ [Put out the flames] -> put_out_flames
+ [Stay put and pray] -> stay_and_pray

=== walk_into_fire ===
The rat walks into the fire and dies a terrible death ðŸ”¥ðŸ’€ -> end

=== put_out_flames ===
There are many possible utensils at the rat's disposal:
+ [Throw straw at the fire] -> straw_at_fire
+ [Throw wet mud at the fire] -> ambulance_rescue

=== stay_and_pray ===
The rat prays to the great rats far down below.
